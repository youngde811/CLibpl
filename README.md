# Welcome to the CLibpl Project #

This repository serves as a support package for those projects requiring the linkage of our _libpl_ project, which
offers a small Debian package used to provide Swift applications access to the libc _getcontext()_ function.

_CLibpl_ exists to conform to the current Swift Package Manager (SPM) requirements for adding C system libraries to
Swift application code. There's not much here; the only truly relevant file is _module.modulemap_.
